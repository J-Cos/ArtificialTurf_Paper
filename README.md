# ArtificialTurf_Paper
 Code for a remote sensing paper on artifical turf prevelence in Greater London

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Create Directory Structure
Create a project directory with the following subdirectories
- Code (contaning a clone of this repo)
- Data/Stevenage (containing i) clipped2015.tif; ii) clipped2019.tif, and iii) a directory called 'test_train' containing the reference data shapefile
- Outputs (into which intermediate and final outputs will be written)
- Figures (into which heuristic visualisations and paper figures will be written)

### Step 2 - Run Code
- Run the code scripts in the order they are numbered, each relies on outputs from those before.
- No paths need to be changed if the directory structure above is implemented as the code uses only relative paths.
